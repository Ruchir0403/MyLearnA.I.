									<h2>1. Assessment and Profiling:</h2>

									<h2>4. Adaptive Learning Modules:</h2>
									<p>Our adaptive learning modules are designed to challenge and engage you at the right level. As you progress through the curriculum, our AI system continuously analyzes your performance and adjusts the difficulty of the content accordingly. This ensures that you are always appropriately challenged, helping you stay motivated and grow academically.</p>
									
									<h2>5. Progress Tracking and Insights:</h2>
									<p>We believe in the power of data-driven insights. With our data analytics dashboard, you and your educators can track your progress in real-time.
